# mass_attraction

mass_attraction is a small JavaScript app that shows how moving objects are influenced by static masses.
By clicking you can set three static masses (the last set mass will disapear by creating a new one).
There is a ++slider** in the upper left corner which sets the amount of moving masses.

It uses the p5.js library.
